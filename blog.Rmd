## Some speed comparisons between various methods
07/01/2021

The second one is performing $A\times b$, where A is a matrix and b is a vector. The
matrix sizes are 1000 * 10 and 1000 * 50, respectively.

## Unit: microseconds
##                                           expr    min      lq     mean  median
##                                  drop(A %*% b) 16.044 16.7395 17.91799 16.9430
##  .rowSums(A * rep(b, rep(1000, 10)), 1000, 10) 67.569 88.3175 94.86921 91.1955
##       uq     max neval
##  17.6445  68.312   100
##  96.6670 130.533   100
```

```
## Unit: microseconds
##                                           expr     min       lq     mean
##                                  drop(A %*% b)  56.029  56.9955  65.2491
##  .rowSums(A * rep(b, rep(1000, 50)), 1000, 50) 262.426 322.2330 355.8702
##    median      uq     max neval
##   63.0290  72.912 116.609   100
##  344.1385 392.860 473.949   100
```

The first way is much faster due to the overhead of replication. Assume A is a $m\times n$ matrix and b is a vector of length $n$. Both methods have the same number of operations ($m\times n$ multiplications and $m\times (n - 1)$ additions.), but the overhead of doing replication in the second method is much slower than dropping the attribute in the first method.
