 abstract = {While educational programs and professional journals typically devote much of their resources to exact, mathematically elegant methods for the solution of small or modest size problems, the practitioner often encounters large-scale or massive problems for which such exact methods hold little promise. This paper discusses this phenomena and presents some thoughts as to the incorporation of guidelines through which largescale problems may be solved by means of efficient heuristic techniques. Further, these heuristics are classified and related to a fundamental set of base heuristics.},

We propose a family of methods for establishing lower 100(1 - α)% confidence bounds for this proportion, based on the empirical distribution of the p-values of the tests. Methods in this family are then compared in terms of ability to consistently estimate the proportion by letting α → 0 as the number of hypothesis tests increases and the proportion decreases. This work is motivated by a signal detection problem that occurs in astronomy.},

    abstract = {For high dimensional statistical models, researchers have begun to focus on situations which can be described as having relatively few moderately large coefficients. Such situations lead to some very subtle statistical problems. In particular, Ingster and Donoho and Jin have considered a sparse normal means testing problem, in which they described the precise demarcation or detection boundary. Meinshausen and Rice have shown that it is even possible to estimate consistently the fraction of nonzero coordinates on a subset of the detectable region, but leave unanswered the question of exactly in which parts of the detectable region consistent estimation is possible. In the present paper we develop a new approach for estimating the fraction of nonzero means for problems where the nonzero means are moderately large. We show that the detection region described by Ingster and Donoho and Jin turns out to be the region where it is possible to consistently estimate the expected fraction of nonzero coordinates. This theory is developed further and minimax rates of convergence are derived. A procedure is constructed which attains the optimal rate of convergence in this setting. Furthermore, the procedure also provides an honest lower bound for confidence intervals while minimizing the expected length of such an interval. Simulations are used to enable comparison with the work of Meinshausen and Rice, where a procedure is given but where rates of convergence have not been discussed. Extensions to more general Gaussian mixture models are also given.},

   abstract = {With the increase in genomewide experiments and the sequencing of multiple genomes, the analysis of large data sets has become commonplace in biology. It is often the case that thousands of features in a genomewide data set are tested against some null hypothesis, where a number of features are expected to be significant. Here we propose an approach to measuring statistical significance in these genomewide studies based on the concept of the false discovery rate. This approach offers a sensible balance between the number of true and false positives that is automatically calibrated and easily interpreted. In doing so, a measure of statistical significance called the q value is associated with each tested feature. The q value is similar to the well known p value, except it is a measure of significance in terms of the false discovery rate rather than the false positive rate. Our approach avoids a flood of false positive results, while offering a more liberal criterion than what has been used in genome scans for linkage.},

Microarray expression analysis was used to determine whether global biological differences underlie common pathological features of prostate cancer and to identify genes that might anticipate the clinical behavior of this disease. While no expression correlates of age, serum prostate specific antigen (PSA), and measures of local invasion were found, a set of genes was identified that strongly correlated with the state of tumor differentiation as measured by Gleason score. Moreover, a model using gene expression data alone accurately predicted patient outcome following prostatectomy. These results support the notion that the clinical behavior of prostate cancer is linked to underlying gene expression differences that are detectable at the time of diagnosis."

 abstract = {Suppose that the sum of two independent random variables X and Z is observed, where Z denotes measurement error and has a known distribution, and where the unknown density f of X is to be estimated. One application is the estimation of a prior density for a sequence of location parameters. A second application arises in the errors-in-variables problem for nonlinear and generalized linear models, when one attempts to model the distribution of the true but unobservable covariates. This article shows that if Z is normally distributed and f has k bounded derivatives, then the fastest attainable convergence rate of any nonparametric estimator of f is only (log n)-k/2. Therefore, deconvolution with normal errors may not be a practical proposition. Other error distributions are also treated. Stefanski-Carroll (1987a) estimators achieve the optimal rates. The results given have versions for multiplicative errors, where they imply that even optimal rates are exceptionally slow.},

The literature contains several methods for computing the nonparametric MLE of G, but these methods are slow. In this article we develop an algorithm for maximizing the log-likelihood l(G) over the family G, of all distribution functions, that yields the nonparametric MLE of G. In some semiparametric problems, a structural or fixed parameter β is of interest, and we are interested in computing profile likelihood, $\sup_Gl(G, \beta)$, for a grid of values of β. The algorithm that we propose is fast enough for this purpose. Examples illustrate and compare the algorithms; one taken from an article by Laird, the common mean problem, and one taken from the literature on optimal experimental design. It is also noted that routines from the literature on semi-infinite programming may be used to compute the profile log-likelihood.},

It is an extension of the constrained Newton method for nonparametric mixture estimation. In each iteration, the newly extended algorithm includes, if necessary, new knots that are located via a special directional derivative function. The algorithm renews the changes of slope at all knots via a quadratically convergent method and removes the knots at which the changes of slope become zero. Theoretically, the characterisation of the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimate is studied and the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the unique maximum likelihood estimate. Numerical studies show that it outperforms other algorithms that are available in the literature. Applications to some real-world financial data are also given.},

abstract = {Summary We consider an extension of the recursive bivariate probit model for estimating the effect of a binary variable on a binary outcome in the presence of unobserved confounders, nonlinear covariate effects and overdispersion. Specifically, the model consists of a system of two binary outcomes with a binary endogenous regressor which includes smooth functions of covariates, hence allowing for flexible functional dependence of the responses on the continuous regressors, and arbitrary random intercepts to deal with overdispersion arising from correlated observations on clusters or from the omission of non-confounding covariates. We fit the model by maximizing a penalized likelihood using an Expectation-Maximisation algorithm. The issues of automatic multiple smoothing parameter selection and inference are also addressed. The empirical properties of the proposed algorithm are examined in a simulation study. The method is then illustrated using data from a survey on health, aging and wealth.},

 abstract = {The paper discusses the estimation of an unknown population size n. Suppose that an identification mechanism can identify nobs cases. The Horvitz-Thompson estimator of n adjusts this number by the inverse of $1 -p_0$, where the latter is the probability of not identifying a case. When repeated counts of identifying the same case are available, we can use the counting distribution for estimating p0 to solve the problem. Frequently, the Poisson distribution is used and, more recently, mixtures of Poisson distributions. Maximum likelihood estimation is discussed by means of the EM algorithm. For truncated Poisson mixtures, a nested EM algorithm is suggested and illustrated for several application cases. The algorithmic principles are used to show an inequality, stating that the Horvitz-Thompson estimator of n by using the mixed Poisson model is always at least as large as the estimator by using a homogeneous Poisson model. In turn, if the homogeneous Poisson model is misspecified it will, potentially strongly, underestimate the true population size. Examples from various areas illustrate this finding.},

In this paper we derive MHD estimates for finite Poisson mixtures. The properties of these estimators are examined and a comparison is made of their performance relative to that of the ML estimators. MHD estimators are both efficient and robust. A numerical example involving data sets on environmental complaints is presented. An iterative algorithm that facilitates computation is provided. The algorithm always converges to a minimum, but several initial values are needed to ensure that the global minimum is obtained."

 abstract = {It is shown how and why the influence curve poorly measures the robustness properties of minimum Hellinger distance estimation. Rather, for this and related forms of estimation, there is another function, the residual adjustment function, that carries the relevant information about the trade-off between efficiency and robustness. It is demonstrated that this function determines various second-order measures of efficiency and robustness through a scalar measure called the estimation curvature. The function is also shown to determine the breakdown properties of the estimators through its tail behavior. A 50% breakdown result is given. It is shown how to create flexible classes of estimation methods in the spirit of M-estimation, but with first-order efficiency (or even second-order efficiency) at the chosen model, 50% breakdown and a minimum distance interpretation.},

Some practical issues of implementation of these results are also discussed. Simulation results indicate that ML techniques are superior to MD when component distributions actually are normal, but MD techniques provide better estimates than ML under symmetric departures from component normality. Interestingly, an ad hoc starting value for the iterative procedures occasionally outperformed both the ML and MD techniques.

   abstract = {We study the rates of convergence of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and posterior distribution in density estimation problems, where the densities are location or location-scale mixtures of normal distributions with the scale parameter lying between two positive numbers. The true density is also assumed to lie in this class with the true mixing distribution either compactly supported or having sub-Gaussian tails. We obtain bounds for Hellinger bracketing entropies for this class, and from these bounds, we deduce the convergence rates of (sieve) MLEs in Hellinger distance. The rate turns out to be (log n) $^\kappa/\sqrt{n}$ , where κ≥ 1 is a constant that depends on the type of mixtures and the choice of the sieve. Next, we consider a Dirichlet mixture of normals as a prior on the unknown density. We estimate the prior probability of a certain Kullback-Leibler type neighborhood and then invoke a general theorem that computes the posterior convergence rate in terms the growth rate of the Hellinger entropy and the concentration rate of the prior. The posterior distribution is also seen to converge at the rate (log n) $^\kappa/\sqrt{n}$ in, where κ now depends on the tail behavior of the base measure of the Dirichlet process.},

abstract = {DNA microarrays are a new and promising biotechnology which allows the monitoring of expression levels in cells for thousands of genes simultaneously. The present paper describes statistical methods for the identification of differentially expressed genes in replicated cDNA microarray experiments. Although it is not the main focus of the paper, new methods for the important pre-processing steps of image analysis and normalization are proposed. Given suitably normalized data, the biological question of differential expression is restated as a problem in multiple hypothesis testing: the simultaneous test for each gene of the null hypothesis of no association between the expression levels and responses or covariates of interest. Differentially expressed genes are identified based on adjusted p-values for a multiple testing procedure which strongly controls the family-wise Type I error rate and takes into account the dependence structure between the gene expression levels. No specific parametric form is assumed for the distribution of the test statistics and a permutation procedure is used to estimate adjusted p-values. Several data displays are suggested for the visual identification of differentially expressed genes and of important features of these genes. The above methods are applied to microarray data from a study of gene expression in the livers of mice with very low HDL cholesterol levels. The genes identified using data from multiple slides are compared to those identified by recently published single-slide methods.},

The observed data are assumed to be independently generated conditional on an underlying and unknown two-state hidden model. We propose an asymptotically valid data-driven procedure to find critical values for rejection regions controlling the k-familywise error rate (k-FWER), false discovery rate (FDR) and the tail probability of false discovery proportion (FDTP) by using one-sample and two-sample t-statistics. We only require a finite fourth moment plus some very general conditions on the mean and variance of the population by virtue of the moderate deviations properties of t-statistics. A new consistent estimator for the proportion of alternative hypotheses is developed. Simulation studies support our theoretical results and demonstrate that the power of a multiple testing procedure can be substantially improved by using critical values directly, as opposed to the conventional p-value approach. Our method is applied in an analysis of the microarray data from a leukemia cancer study that involves testing a large number of hypotheses simultaneously.},

 abstract = {Consider the problem of testing s hypotheses simultaneously. The usual approach restricts attention to procedures that control the probability of even one false rejection, the familywise error rate (FWER). If s is large, one might be willing to tolerate more than one false rejection, thereby increasing the ability of the procedure to correctly reject false null hypotheses. One possibility is to replace control of the FWER by control of the probability of k or more false rejections, which is called the k-FWER. We derive both single-step and step-down procedures that control the k-FWER in finite samples or asymptotically, depending on the situation. We also consider the false discovery proportion (FDP) defined as the number of false rejections divided by the total number of rejections (and defined to be 0 if there are no rejections). The false discovery rate proposed by Benjamini and Hochberg [J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 57 (1995) 289-300] controls E(FDP). Here, the goal is to construct methods which satisfy, for a given γ and α, P{FDP > γ} ≤ α, at least asymptotically. In contrast to the proposals of Lehmann and Romano [Ann. Statist. 33 (2005) 1138-1154], we construct methods that implicitly take into account the dependence structure of the individual test statistics in order to further increase the ability to detect false null hypotheses. This feature is also shared by related work of van der Laan, Dudoit and Pollard [Stat. Appl. Genet. Mol. Biol. 3 (2004) article 15], but our methodology is quite different. Like the work of Pollard and van der Laan [Proc. 2003 International Multi-Conference in Computer Science and Engineering, METMBS'03 Conference (2003) 3-9] and Dudoit, van der Laan and Pollard [Stat. Appl. Genet. Mol. Biol. 3 (2004) article 13], we employ resampling methods to achieve our goals. Some simulations compare finite sample performance to currently available methods.},

A few approximation theorems are proved under the mixing condition of Ibragimov (1959), (1962). One of them yields, as a special case and with some improvement, an approximation theorem of Le Cam (1960) for the Poisson binomial distribution. The possibility of an asymptotic expansion is also discussed and a refinement in the independent case obtained.

Then we establish a condition under which a dynamic adaptive procedure, whose ‐parameter is determined by data, will lead to conservative ‐ and FDR estimators. We also present asymptotic results on simultaneous conservative FDR estimation and control for a class of dynamic adaptive procedures. Simulation results show that a novel dynamic adaptive procedure achieves more power through smaller estimation errors for under independence and mild dependence conditions. We conclude by discussing the connection between estimation and control of the FDR and show that several recently developed FDR control procedures can be cast in a unifying framework where the strength of the procedures can be easily evaluated.},

The problem of estimating Σ when p is much larger than n has received a lot of attention in recent years. Yet, little is known about the information criterion for covariance matrix estimation. How to properly define such a criterion and what are the statistical properties? We attempt to answer these questions in this paper by focusing on the estimation of bandable covariance matrices when p > n but log(p) = o(n). Motivated by the deep connection between Stein's unbiased risk estimation (SURE) and Akaike information criterion (AIC) in regression models, we propose a family of generalized SURE (SUREc) indexed by c for covariance matrix estimation, where c is some constant. When c is 2, SURE2 provides an unbiased estimator of the Frobenius risk of the covariance matrix estimator. Furthermore, we show that by minimizing SURE2 over all possible banding covariance matrix estimators, we attain the minimax optimal rate of convergence under the Frobenius norm, and the resulting estimator behaves like the covariance matrix estimator obtained by the so-called oracle tuning. When the true covariance matrix is exactly banded, we prove that by minimizing SURE<sub>log(n)</sub>, we select the true bandwidth with probability tending to one. Therefore, our analysis indicates that SURE2 and SURE<sub>log(n)</sub> can be regarded as the AIC and Bayesian information criterion for large covariance matrix estimation, respectively.</p>},

abstract = {The existence and uniqueness of a limiting form of a Huber-type M-estimator of multivariate scatter is established under certain conditions on the observed sample. These conditions hold with probability one when sampling randomly from a continuous multivariate distribution. The existence of the estimator is proven by showing that it is the limiting point of a specific algorithm. Hence, the proof is constructive. For continuous populations, the estimator of multivariate scatter is shown to be strongly consistent and asymptotically normal. An important property of the estimator is that its asymptotic distribution is distribution-free with respect to the class of continuous elliptically distributed populations. This distribution-free property also holds for the finite sample size distribution when the location parameter is known. In addition, the estimator is the "most robust" estimator of the scatter matrix of an elliptical distribution in the sense of minimizing the maximum asymptotic variance.},

abstract = {Abstract Covariance matrix estimation plays an important role in statistical analysis in many fields, including (but not limited to) portfolio allocation and risk management in finance, graphical modeling, and clustering for genes discovery in bioinformatics, Kalman filtering and factor analysis in economics. In this paper, we give a selective review of covariance and precision matrix estimation when the matrix dimension can be diverging with, or even larger than the sample size. Two broad categories of regularization methods are presented. The first category exploits an assumed structure of the covariance or precision matrix for consistent estimation. The second category shrinks the eigenvalues of a sample covariance matrix, knowing from random matrix theory that such eigenvalues are biased from the population counterparts when the matrix dimension grows at the same rate as the sample size. This article is categorized under: Statistical and Graphical Methods of Data Analysis > Analysis of High Dimensional Data Statistical and Graphical Methods of Data Analysis > Multivariate Analysis Statistical and Graphical Methods of Data Analysis > Nonparametric Methods},

abstract = {Estimation of high dimensional covariance matrices is known to be a difficult problem, has many applications and is of current interest to the larger statistics community. In many applications including the so‐called ‘large , small ’ setting, the estimate of the covariance matrix is required to be not only invertible but also well conditioned. Although many regularization schemes attempt to do this, none of them address the ill conditioning problem directly. We propose a maximum likelihood approach, with the direct goal of obtaining a well‐conditioned estimator. No sparsity assumptions on either the covariance matrix or its inverse are imposed, thus making our procedure more widely applicable. We demonstrate that the proposed regularization scheme is computationally efficient, yields a type of Steinian shrinkage estimator and has a natural Bayesian interpretation. We investigate the theoretical properties of the regularized covariance estimator comprehensively, including its regularization path, and proceed to develop an approach that adaptively determines the level of regularization that is required. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the regularized estimator in decision theoretic comparisons and in the financial portfolio optimization setting. The approach proposed has desirable properties and can serve as a competitive procedure, especially when the sample size is small and when a well‐conditioned estimator is required.},

If the data represent a random sample, then a natural question to ask is whether such binned data may successfully be used for density estimation. Here we consider three density procedures: the histogram, parametric models determined by a few moments, and the nonparametric kernel density estimator of Parzen and Rosenblatt. For the histogram, we show that computer-binning causes no problem as long as the binning is sufficiently smaller than the data-based bin width 3.5$\sigma$ n−1/3. Another result is that some binning of data appears to provide marginal improvement in the integrated mean squared error of the corresponding kernel estimate. Some examples are given to illustrate the theoretical and visual effects of using binned data.",

Based on an extensive literature search for the one-sided one-sample K-S test, this paper identifies two direct formulae and five recursion formulae that can be used to calculate a p value and then develops two additional direct formulae and four iterative versions of the direct formulae for a total of thirteen formulae. To ensure accurate calculation by avoiding catastrophic cancelation and eliminating rounding error, each formula is implemented in rational arithmetic.

abstract = {Gaussian mixtures provide a convenient method of density estimation that lies somewhere between parametric models and kernel density estimators. When the number of components of the mixture is allowed to increase as sample size increases, the model is called a mixture sieve. We establish a bound on the rate of convergence in Hellinger distance for density estimation using the Gaussian mixture sieve assuming that the true density is itself a mixture of Gaussians; the underlying mixing measure of the true density is not necessarily assumed to have finite support. Computing the rate involves some delicate calculations since the size of the sieve-as measured by bracketing entropy-and the saturation rate, cannot be found using standard methods. When the mixing measure has compact support, using k n ∼ n 2/3 /(log n) 1/3 components in the mixture yields a rate of order (log n) (1+η)/6 /n 1/6 for every $\eta > 0$ . The rates depend heavily on the tail behavior of the true density. The sensitivity to the tail behavior is diminished by using a robust sieve which includes a long-tailed component in the mixture. In the compact case, we obtain an improved rate of (log n/n) 1/4 . In the noncompact case, a spectrum of interesting rates arise depending on the thickness of the tails of the mixing measure.},

 abstract = {In the estimation of the covariance matrix of the multivariate normal distribution with unknown mean vector, Sinha and Ghosh (1987) proposed a truncated estimator improving on the best invariant one relative to the entropy loss. The purpose of the paper is to derive an empirical Bayes estimator based on conjugate priors and to prove that it is better than the Sinha-Ghosh estimator. An empirical Bayes estimator for the generalized variance is also given and it is shown to be identical to the usual Stein type truncated est mator.},

abstract = "When a projection of a symmetric or Hermitian matrix to the positive semidefinite cone is computed approximately (or to working precision on a computer), a natural question is to quantify its accuracy. A straightforward bound invoking standard eigenvalue perturbation theory (e.g. Davis-Kahan and Weyl bounds) suggests that the accuracy would be inversely proportional to the spectral gap, implying it can be poor in the presence of small eigenvalues. This work shows that a small gap is not a concern for projection onto the semidefinite cone, by deriving error bounds that are gap-independent."

We show how the modified alternating projections method can be used to compute the solution for the more commonly used of the weighted Frobenius norms. In the finance application the original matrix has many zero or negative eigenvalues; we show that for a certain class of weights the nearest correlation matrix has correspondingly many zero eigenvalues and that this fact can be exploited in the computation.},

 abstract = {Much recent effort has sought asymptotically minimax methods for recovering infinite dimensional objects--curves, densities, spectral densities, images--from noisy data. A now rich and complex body of work develops nearly or exactly minimax estimators for an array of interesting problems. Unfortunately, the results have rarely moved into practice, for a variety of reasons--among them being similarity to known methods, computational intractability and lack of spatial adaptivity. We discuss a arise from iterated mappings of the centre of the interval to which the map is applied. Particular attention is paid to the shape of an invariant distribution in the tails or in the neighbourhood of a pole of its density. A new technique is developed for this application. It enables us to combine `parametric' information, available from the structure of the map, with `nonparametric' information obtainable from numerical experiments.},

Alternatives to the usual unbiased property are examined with respect to invariance under simultaneous one-to-one transformation of parameter and estimate; one of these alternatives, closely related to the maximum likelihood method, seems to be new. The property of being unbiased in the likelihood sense is essentially equivalent to the statement that the estimate is a maximum likelihood estimate based on some distribution derived by integration from the original sampling distribution, by virtue of a "hereditary" property of maximum likelihood estimation. An exposition of maximum likelihood estimation is given in terms of optimum pairwise selection with equal weights, providing a type of rationale for small sample estimation by maximum likelihood.},

    abstract = { An asymmetrical frequency curve may arise from two quite distinct classes of causes. In the first place the material measured may be heterogeneous and may consist of, a mixture of two or more homogeneous materials. Such frequency curves, for example, arise when we have a mixed population of two different races, a homogeneous population with a sprinkling of diseased or deformed members, a curve for tbe frequency of matrimony covering more than one class of the population, or in economics a frequency of interest curve for securities of different types of stabilit — railways and government stocks mixed with mining and financial companies. The treatment of this class of frequency curves requires us to break up the original curve into component parts, or simple frequency curves. This branch of the subject (for the special case of the compound being the sum of two normal curves) has been treated in a paper presented to the Poyal Society by the author, on October 18,1893. 1 lie second class of frequency curves arises in the case of homogeneous material when the tendency to deviation on one side of the mean is unequal to the tendency to deviation on the other side. Such curves arise in many physical, economic and biological investigations, for example, in frequency curves for the height of the barometer, in those for prices and for rates of interest of securities of the same class, in mortality curves, especially the percentage of deaths to cases in all kinds of fevers, in income tax and house duty returns, and in various types of anthropological measurements. I t is this class of curves, which are dealt with in the present paper. The general type of this class of frequency curve will be found to vary (see Plate 7, fig. 1) through all phases from the form close to the negative exponential curve: y = Ce-px, to a form close to the normal frequency curve y = Ce-px2 where C and p are constants. }

Two of those algorithms, an iterative convex minorant and an active set algorithm, are implemented in the R package logcondens. While these algorithms are discussed elsewhere, we describe in this paper the use of the logcondens package and discuss functions and datasets related to log-concave density estimation contained in the package. In particular, we provide functions to (1) compute the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) as well as a smoothed log-concave density estimator derived from the MLE, (2) evaluate the estimated density, distribution and quantile functions at arbitrary points, (3) compute the characterizing functions of the MLE, (4) sample from the estimated distribution, and finally (5) perform a two-sample permutation test using a modified Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic.

Here, a generic approach to cancer classification based on gene expression monitoring by DNA microarrays is described and applied to human acute leukemias as a test case. A class discovery procedure automatically discovered the distinction between acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) without previous knowledge of these classes. An automatically derived class predictor was able to determine the class of new leukemia cases. The results demonstrate the feasibility of cancer classification based solely on gene expression monitoring and suggest a general strategy for discovering and predicting cancer classes for other types of cancer, independent of previous biological knowledge.},

 abstract = {Consider the problem of simultaneously testing null hypotheses H1,..., Hs. The usual approach to dealing with the multiplicity problem is to restrict attention to procedures that control the familywise error rate (FWER), the probability of even one false rejection. In many applications, particularly if s is large, one might be willing to tolerate more than one false rejection provided the number of such cases is controlled, thereby increasing the ability of the procedure to detect false null hypotheses. This suggests replacing control of the FWER by controlling the probability of k or more false rejections, which we call the k-FWER. We derive both single-step and stepdown procedures that control the k-FWER, without making any assumptions concerning the dependence structure of the p-values of the individual tests. In particular, we derive a stepdown procedure that is quite simple to apply, and prove that it cannot be improved without violation of control of the k-FWER. We also consider the false discovery proportion (FDP) defined by the number of false rejections divided by the total number of rejections (defined to be 0 if there are no rejections). The false discovery rate proposed by Benjamini and Hochberg [J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 57 (1995) 289-300] controls E(FDP). Here, we construct methods such that, for any γ and α, $P{FDP>\gamma}\leq\alpha$. Two stepdown methods are proposed. The first holds under mild conditions on the dependence structure of p-values, while the second is more conservative but holds without any dependence assumptions.},

abstract = {A training algorithm that maximizes the margin between the training patterns and the decision boundary is presented. The technique is applicable to a wide variety of the classification functions, including Perceptrons, polynomials, and Radial Basis Functions. The effective number of parameters is adjusted automatically to match the complexity of the problem. The solution is expressed as a linear combination of supporting patterns. These are the subset of training patterns that are closest to the decision boundary. Bounds on the generalization performance based on the leave-one-out method and the VC-dimension are given. Experimental results on optical character recognition problems demonstrate the good generalization obtained when compared with other learning algorithms.},

abstract = {In the context of modern portfolio theory, we compare the out-of-sample performance of eight investment strategies which are based on statistical methods with the out-of-sample performance of a family of trivial strategies. A wide range of approaches is considered in this work, including the traditional sample-based approach, several minimum-variance techniques, a shrinkage, and a minimax approach. In contrast to similar studies in the literature, we also consider short-selling constraints and a risk-free asset. We provide a way to extend the concept of minimum-variance strategies in the context of short-selling constraints. A main drawback of most empirical studies on that topic is the use of simple testing procedures which do not account for the effects of multiple testing. For that reason we conduct several hypothesis tests which are proposed in the multiple-testing literature. We test whether it is possible to beat a trivial strategy by at least one of the non-trivial strategies, whether the trivial strategy is better than every non-trivial strategy, and which of the non-trivial strategies is significantly outperformed by naive diversification. The empirical part of our study is conducted using US stock returns from the last four decades, obtained via the CRSP database.},

We describe methods for familywise error control, false discovery rate control and false discovery proportion estimation and confidence, both conceptually and practically, and explain when to use which type of error rate. We elaborate on the assumptions underlying the methods and discuss pitfalls in the interpretation of results. In our discussion, we take into account the exploratory nature of genomics experiments, looking at selection of genes before or after testing, and at the role of validation experiments.

abstract = "A crucial step in all gradient-based algorithms for calculating the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator in mixture models is the global maximization of the gradient function. For example, in mixtures of exponentials, the methods usually proposed fail. Based on a discretization which is adapted to the data points, a method for maximizing the gradient is suggested. The method is implemented in different gradient-based algorithms; a comparison shows that on mixtures of exponentials, the ISDM algorithm introduced by Lesperance and Kalbfleisch is much faster than its competitors."
